## Box Model Practice
Using what we learned about four components of the box model today: margin, border, padding, and content, make the "Questions" column look like the "Answers" column.

Under each selector, write the CSS rule to make it match the "Answers" side.

If you aren't sure if some of the boxes look right, remember you can open up your Webview in a separate tab.

### Bonus Challenges
- Make a grooved border around one of your answers.
- Make the border edges rounded for one of your answers. (Use Google if you need help figuring out what the property name is to do this!)
